# navbar-responsive

This project is a navbar responsive using HTML/CSS, it is an element of conception which allows it to adapt to the size of the screen used by the user, for example mobile, tablet or desktop.

I used media query css to define the responsivity.

I created a clickable drop-down menu using an icon bars which automatically displays the navigation links.
